## 📖 Project Experience

**Culture Party** was developed as part of my college **capstone project**, spanning six months of dedicated work. This project gave me in-depth experience in **multiplayer game development**, a field I was eager to explore.

During development, I learned how to:
- **Replicate variables and actions across clients**
- Understand the relationship between the **server and clients** in multiplayer gameplay
- Handle complex features like **level changes in online environments**, including world partitioning and conditional visibility of the minigame map

Beyond networking, I also took on creative and technical tasks:
- Composed and implemented the **game's original soundtrack**
- Designed and programmed the **UI**
- Developed a **quality settings system** to allow for performance customization

This project pushed my technical skills and creativity, while also giving me valuable experience collaborating and delivering a full-scale game. It was one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my academic career.

Enjoy exploring the project! 🎮🌍🎉
